# Roadmap

#### Alpha Testing

* **Enable ZKP Verification on Mobile Nodes:**
  * Launch the initial testing phase to enable Zero-Knowledge Proof verification capabilities on mobile nodes.
* **Integration with Babylon & BitVM2 (Consensus):**
  * Integrate the Fiamma network with Babylon for staking and with BitVM2 for enhanced consensus mechanisms.

#### Beta Testing&#x20;

* **Support Mobiles as Monitor Nodes:**
  * Expand support for mobile devices to function as monitoring nodes within the network, ensuring broad participation and decentralization.
* **Integration with Nubit (Data Availability):**
  * Integrate with Nubit to enhance data availability, ensuring that proof data is securely stored and easily accessible.

#### Mainnet Launch

* **Allow Staking of Nodes and General Users:**
  * Open up the network for node operators and general users to participate in staking, enhancing network security and decentralization.
* **Activate Intersubjective Slashing:**
  * Implement intersubjective slashing mechanisms to penalize malicious activities and ensure the integrity and security of the network.
