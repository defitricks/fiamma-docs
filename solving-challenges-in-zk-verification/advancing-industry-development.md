# Advancing Industry Development

Beyond solving existing problems, Fiamma is also poised to drive the industry forward through its innovative features:

1. **Implementation of BitVM2**
   * As the first to implement Fflonk and Groth16 in Bitcoin Script, we are leading the R\&D of BitVM2. BitVM2 secures our ZK verification network, Fiamma, and any integrated ZK use cases with the Bitcoin network. Fiamma leverages the Bitcoin network to settle critical disputes among our intersubjective and objective nodes via BitVM2.
2. **Modular Design**:
   * Fiamma's architecture is modular, consisting of distinct but interoperable components for execution, data availability (DA), settlement, and storage, allowing for flexibility and specialization within the network.
3. **Decentralized Node Design with Low Barriers to Entry**:
   * By designing a system with low thresholds for node participation, Fiamma opens up the network to a wider community, fostering a more decentralized and resilient ecosystem.
4. **Universal Settlement Network**:
   * For blockchains with limited programmability, such as Bitcoin, Fiamma offers a foundational layer of functionality, enhancing their capabilities and meeting their base requirements.
   * For highly programmable chains like Ethereum and Solana, Fiamma serves as a layer that improves user experience (UX), decentralization, and security by offering a more efficient and seamless settlement process secured by Bitcoin network.

Fiamma is a universal verification network with high security and decentralization, designed to support the growth of ZK use cases across all blockchain platforms. It is a vital infrastructure for the future of blockchain technology and applications.
