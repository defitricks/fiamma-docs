# Introduction

Fiamma is emerging as a verification network that specializes in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, striving to provide a secure, decentralized, and economically efficient solution for universal blockchain integration. At its heart, Fiamma is engineered to leverage the robust cryptoeconomic and network security value of Bitcoin via the integration with Babylon and implementation of BitVM2. This combination enables Fiamma to introduce ZK capabilities into the Bitcoin ecosystem and secure ZK use cases in Ethereum and beyond, enhancing the scope and effectiveness of ZK technology.
