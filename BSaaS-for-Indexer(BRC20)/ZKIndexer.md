# ZKIndexer

The main problem with the BRC-20 Indexer is its centralized and isolated setup, requiring users to trust an off-chain indexer. Fiamma can enable a trustless, decentralized, and unified indexer, facilitating the growth of the BRC-20 market.

Current solutions without Fiamma:
1. Centralized indexer - the value of the BRC-20 token is secured by a centralized off-line indexer, subject to manipulation;
2. Separated ledger - different projects may operate different indexers, causing a wrong token value;
Solution-1 with Fiamma (ZKIndexer):
1. Secured by Bitcoin - By integrating the Fiamma, the value of the BRC-20 token is secured by Bitcoin via Babylon and BitVM2;
2. Separated ledger - different projects may operate different indexers, causing token loss;
Solution-2 with Fiamma (ZKIndexer chain):
1. Secured by Bitcoin - By integrating the Fiamma, the value of the BRC-20 token is secured by Bitcoin via Babylon and BitVM2;
2. Unified ledger - the same ledger, the same value;
