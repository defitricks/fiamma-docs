In Fiamma DA Alpha Testnet, users can receive FIA tokens through two methods: the Discord channel and the web faucet. Each method has its own limits and conditions, and these two methods are not mutually exclusive.

- **Discord Faucet**: Each address/Discord ID can receive 0.05 FIA per day, but each address can only claim once every 24 hours.

- **Web Faucet**: Each address can receive 0.1 FIA daily, but each device can only claim once every 24 hours.

**Note**: Addresses with a balance exceeding 5 FIA will not be eligible to receive additional FIA from the faucet. The provided tokens should be sufficient to cover gas fees under normal circumstances, so please use them wisely. If you need more FIA, please contact the FIA team. 

#### Web Faucet
The web faucet is available at: [faucet FIA](https://testnet-faucet.fiammachain.io).

Users can claim 0.1 FIA per day, but each device is restricted to one claim every 24 hours.

#### Discord Faucet
Join Fiamma discord server by this invitation: [Fiamma](https://discord.gg/jTXWxKmG).

To request tokens from the Fiamma DA Alpha Testnet Faucet, use the following command in the `#[testnet-faucet]` channel on Fiammaâ€™s Discord server:

`$request <FIAMMA-ADDRESS>`

Where `<FIAMMA-ADDRESS>` is a generated address starting with Fiamma.
