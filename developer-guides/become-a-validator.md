# Become a Validator

### Prerequisites[â€‹](https://docs.babylonchain.io/docs/user-guides/btc-staking-testnet/become-validator#prerequisites) <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

Having a full node setup and synced by following this guide

### 1. Create a Keyring and Get Funds <a href="#id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds" id="id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds"></a>

The Getting Testnet Tokens page contains detailed instructions on how to create a keyring and get funds for it through a faucet.

### 2. Get Validator Key <a href="#id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds" id="id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds"></a>

You can get the validator key for the current node using the following command. You'll need to write it down. You'll need it next.

```bash
fiammad tendermint show-validator
```

### 3. Get Node Moniker <a href="#id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds" id="id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds"></a>

You can get the node moniker for the current node using the following command. You'll need to write it down. You'll need it next.

```bash
fiammad config get config moniker
```

### 3. Create A Validator Config File <a href="#id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds" id="id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds"></a>

You can modify the information of your validator as you wish, the following is just an example

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash">cat &#x3C;&#x3C; EOF > ~/.fiamma/config/validator.json
{
	"pubkey": {"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"awLUxRg/gS93ARZtFZO9hUpPOsAgh+sco1wxSymQW44="},
	"amount": "100000ufia",
	"moniker": <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">mynode</a>,
	"commission-rate": "0.1",
	"commission-max-rate": "0.2",
	"commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
	"min-self-delegation": "1"
}
EOF
</code></pre>

### 4. Staking And Become  A Validator <a href="#id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds" id="id-1-create-a-keyring-and-get-funds"></a>

Now you can create a pledge transaction to complete the creation of the validator

```bash
fiammad tx staking create-validator ~/.fiamma/config/validator.json --from $KEYNAME --chain-id fiamma-testnet-1 --node "https://testnet-rpc.fiammachain.io/ --fees 2000ufia"
```

### 5. Verify your Validator <a href="#id-5-verify-your-validator" id="id-5-verify-your-validator"></a>

To verify that you have become a validator, first find your validator address:

```bash
fiammad keys show $KEYNAME -a --bech val
```

where `$KEYNAME` is the name of the key that you used for the self-delegation (e.g. `my-key` on our example). This will return an address which you can use as the `$ADDR` variable to perform the following query:

```bash
fiammad query staking validator $ADDR
```

If all goes well, you should see a response indicating the parameters that you specified on the create-validator transaction.
